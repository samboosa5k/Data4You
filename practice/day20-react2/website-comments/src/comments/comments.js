  text: 'Being offended is not the problem. Things that are grotesque should offend you on some level, thats natural. The problem is that the offended culture is moving away from its original intent( please, sir, dont pee in public) to being used as a power play( please stop mansplaining ). This isnt a new thing.In the 80s and 90s, outraged parents attempted to stop( or hinder ) the sale of violent media to kids.Some of these efforts were normal and good( kids probably shouldnt have played manhunter ), but others were just a way for politicians to build a career through being offended.If youre offended by something, and want to say something, then do it.Genuine offense to something obscene is good( many might feel the same way ).Itâ€™s insincere acts of offendness that is being argued against.'
