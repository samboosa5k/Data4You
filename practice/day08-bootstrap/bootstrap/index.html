                Dredd is a fantastic film; laser focused, true to the spirit of the comic book character, and filled with ratcheting tension and killer hard-R action set pieces. That it resembles The Raid in structure and didn’t light the box office on
                fire
                are incidental to how truly awesome the film itself is.

                It’s great news, then, that it’s getting the 4K Blu-ray treatment from Lionsgate. Rumors are swirling as I type that Karl Urban, the titular (and definitive… Sorry, Sly) Dredd, may be returning to voice the character in an
                adult-skewing
                animated television show exploring Mega-City One. I would absolutely welcome that since this property has so much sci-fi action gold to mine. And since this film garnered fan and critical acclaim but no financial breakthrough, an
                animated
                series sounds like a perfectly wonderful way to keep this property in front of people’s eyeballs. The re-release of this film on 4K is another!

                Shot and designed for a 3D experience, this release actually includes a 3D Blu-ray disc, though the 4K disc does not support 3D. There was a visual intention behind the design of this film that really keeps it memorable,
                with or without 3D. A
                new drug called Slo-Mo is circulating through Mega-City One and its users experience reality in a slowed down state that is visualized here with stunning clarity and color. What could have been a gimmick becomes a central
                plot device and a
                trademark visual of the film. The experience of falling off of a skyscraper on Slo-Mo, for instance, feels like eternity for the poor schmuck doing the falling. And director Pete Travis and cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle
                (heck, even
                composer Paul Leonard-Morgan) take every opportunity to make this Slo-Mo storyline pop, ripple, and explode. While this film takes place almost entirely in the slum-like Peach Trees mega tower, making it a dreary and dark
                affair, the film
                nevertheless becomes an enjoyable title to experience on 4K due to this visual flair.

                    Taking place over a single day, writer Alex Garland drafts a clean and entertaining adventure for Dredd which also humorously insinuates this is “just another day” for The Law. Informing his trainee, the psychic new recruit Anderson
                    (Olivia
                    Thirlby), that Judges are only able to respond to roughly 6% of the sprawling mega city’s crimes, Dredd and Anderson simply answer a call to the nearest triple homicide, and soon find themselves trapped in the tower of the dreaded
                    gangster
                    Ma-Ma (Lena Heady crushing it as a scarred drug lord) with no way to escape except to kill ’em all. In this apocalyptic future, Judges act as jury and executioner, barely containing the chaos of mega cities surrounded by scorched
                    wastelands. Dredd is a kind of embodiment of the oppressive state, while at the same time being the uncontested hero of the story. There’s a wonderful balance struck of thrilling entertainment and square-jawed (and frown-faced) triumph
                    of
                    The Man. The satire elements are sprinkled just liberally enough through this otherwise kickass action movie that it all feels just right. One almost feels that Dredd’s singular and unwavering devotion to the law is the key to holding
                    this
                    tenuous society from teetering right off the brink. Yet here in 2017 (and even written into this “day in the life” story) we experience a corrupt and broken system of law all the time, and we’re reminded that it’s a dangerous thing
                    indeed
                    for anyone to have the power of judge, jury, and executioner.

                    So much of the impetus for Dredd to keep being adapted and readapted for current mediums is the brilliant foundation the original character was built on in the pages of British comics 2000 A.D. Creators John Wagner and Carlos Ezquerra
                    have
                    simply created an iconic and enduring character that, while maybe not hugely mainstream in the United States, nevertheless remains compelling and relevant. Famously never depicted without wearing his signature helmet, Dredd is always
                    The
                    Law. This trope was abandoned in Stallone’s Judge Dredd, much to fans’ dismay. And while this critic finds a lot to like in the high profile failure of that project, 2012’s Dredd nails Wagner and Ezquerra’s character far more squarely
                    than
                    1995’s adaptation. The world Dredd traverses is also a major ingredient to the endurance of the character. We’re obsessed with post apocalyptic societies and the Mega-Cities built atop the earth’s scorched remains feel like a distinct
                    and
                    unique element of this particular apocalypse. A billion stories could be told (and have been told over the years) about the goings on in Mega-City One. Which is another reason the “day in the life” approach of this film works so
                    wonderfully. Had Dredd taken off financially, there clearly would have been many more stories to tell in the chaotic mega city, and this fan would have loved to see what else Travis and Garland might have had up their sleeves.
